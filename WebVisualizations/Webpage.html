<h1>Summary:</h1>
<h3>Proving temperatures get hotter as you move to the equator.</h3>

	<p>The Purpose of this project was to gather weather data from over 500 different latitude and longitudes around the world.  By graphing the temperature by latitude we are able to visually see that as you travel closer to the equator, temperatures do increase.</p>

	<h2>Project Steps</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Use a loop and API calls to pull our data set</li>
		<li>Sort and clean our data into a data frame with pandas</li>
		<li>Graph the data frame with matplotlib</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Our API queries also returned data for cloudiness, humidity, and wind speeds which we also graphed with matplotlib.  It can be shown that these data points are not affected by proximity to the equator.</p>
